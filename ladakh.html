        Gonchas, the traditional robes worn in Ladakh and other Himalayan regions, are made through a process that involves weaving, cutting, stitching, and often embroidery. Here is an overview of how Gonchas are typically made:
        1. Material Selection: Choose wool, including Pashmina, for warmth.
        2. Wool Preparation: Clean and process the wool for weaving.
        3. Weaving: Use traditional handlooms to weave the wool into fabric.
        4. Cutting and Stitching: Cut and stitch the fabric to create the Goncha's body, sleeves, collar, and hood.
        5. Optional Embroidery: Add intricate embroidery for decoration and cultural significance.
        6. Finishing Touches: Trim threads, reinforce seams, and ensure quality.
