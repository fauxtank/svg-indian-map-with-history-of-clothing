        The Kanjivaram saree, also known as the Kanchipuram saree, originated in the town of Kanchipuram in Tamil Nadu, India, over 1,000 years ago. The town is known as a hub of silk weaving, and the art of weaving silk sarees is said to have originated during the Chola dynasty

        How Theyâ€™re Made
    </h1>
    <p>
        Kanjivaram sarees are hand-woven with mulberry silk, zari threads, and silver or gold. The silk is dyed and then dipped in rice water and dried in the sun to increase its thickness and rigidity. The weaver then interweaves silver wire with the silk threads, and finishes the weave with golden thread. The warp frame used to weave the fabric has 240 holes in the warp and around 60 holes in the weft with 250-3000 threads. The saree's pallu, border, and body are usually knitted individually and then stitched together.
