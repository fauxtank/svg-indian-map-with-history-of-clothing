        The Paithani saree originated in the medieval town of Paithan, near Aurangabad, in the 6th century B.C. . The saree is named after the town, and is made from very fine mulberry silk. The art is more than 2000 years old and is believed to have been originally made with the finest silk threads from China and pure zari that was spun locally. The saree is characterized by the luxurious and liberal use of gold, as well as floral and bird-inspired motifs.

        How Theyâ€™re Made
    </h1>
    <p>
        Paithani sarees are made from mulberry silk yarn, zari, filature silk, charakha silk, pure gold, and silver. The weaving process is called "tapestry" weaving, which is labor intensive and time consuming. The loom is generally made of teak wood as it is more durable and less prone to warping or decay. The raw silk threads are dyed using natural dyes from vegetables, plants, rocks, and minerals. The threads are then loaded onto the loom, which can take an entire day.
