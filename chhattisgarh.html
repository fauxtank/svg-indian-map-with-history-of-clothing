    <h1>
        Tracing Its Origin
    </h1>
    <p>
        Kosa silk, also known as Tussar silk, is a type of silk that originated in the Chhattisgarh districts of Champa and Korba. It is extracted from the cocoons of the antheraea mylitta silkworm, which builds its cocoons on arjun, sal, and saja trees that are native to India. The process of making Kosa silk is long and arduous, with only skilled men sorting the larvae, which are the primary source of silk. The larvae are then transferred to the trees with fresh leaves.

        How Theyâ€™re Made
    </h1>
    <p>
        Kosa silk sarees are crafted from the cocoons of the Antheraea mylitta silkworm, primarily found in Chhattisgarh. The process begins with silk cultivation, where silkworms feed on specific leaves like Arjun, Saja, or Sal trees. After cocoon formation, they're carefully harvested and boiled to extract silk threads.
