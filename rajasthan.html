        Shisha, also known as mirror work or abhala bharat embroidery, originated in India in the 17th century. It's a traditional South Asian embroidery that involves attaching small pieces of mirror to fabric to create a reflecting pattern. Some say the technique originated in Iran and was introduced to India by the Mughals. Others believe it originated in the 13th century in Persia and came to India during the Mughal era.
