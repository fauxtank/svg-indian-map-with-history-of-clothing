    </h1>
    <p>
        Jainsem is a traditional costume for women in Meghalaya, India that is often made from mulberry silk, a local fabric. The silk saree is wrapped in two ways:
        1. Mulberry silk
        The world's most popular silk, which makes up 80% of silk textiles. The mulberry silkworm, Bombyx mori, feeds on the leaves of the mulberry plant, Morus indica.
        2. Thick cotton cheque cloth
        Tied on one shoulder to protect the jainsem from getting spoiled while working
