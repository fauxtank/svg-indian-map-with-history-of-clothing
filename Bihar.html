        Tracing Its Origin
    </h1>
    <p>
        Bhagalpuri silk sarees, also known as Tussar silk, are made in the Bhagalpur district of Bihar, India, using silk from the cocoons of the Antheraea paphia silkworm. The silkworms are native to India and live in the wild in trees of the Terminalia species. The process of making the silk involves:
        1. Reeling: Boiling the cocoons in a mixture of water and soda for up to two hours
        2. Skeining: Transforming the bamboo spools into a loosely-coiled length of thread or yarn
