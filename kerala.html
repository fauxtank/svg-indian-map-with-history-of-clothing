        The Kasavu technique originated in the South Indian state of Kerala and is believed to date back to the Buddhist era. The white or off-white cotton cloth with Kasavu borders is known as the Kerala saree. The golden borders of the saree, which reflect the sun's rays and evoke memories of Kerala landscapes, contrast with the white color of the saree, which is thought to represent nature's pristine and undisturbed beauty. Together, the saree honors the area's luxuriant foliage and abundant natural beauty.
